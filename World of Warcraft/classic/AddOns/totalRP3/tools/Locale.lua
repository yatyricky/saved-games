--- Total RP 3
--- Localization system
---
--- This new system is based on a meta-table.
--- The goal here is to have IDE auto-completion by directly using the table and
--- accessing its indexes in the code, but actually having the meta table call
--- the localization functions on runtime to get the localized version of the text.

This behavior is not supported at all and we strongly discourage anyone from doing it.

# Changelog version 1.6.4

We are aware of a current issue on Retail causing **quest item usage from the objective tracker** to sometimes fail. While we do not have a fix for it just yet, **typing /reload after getting the error message** temporarily fixes the issue. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## WoW: Classic support

- Total RP 3: Classic is now available as a separate download on CurseForge and WoWInterface! Be sure to install it instead of the retail version of Total RP 3 if you plan on roleplaying in WoW: Classic.
- Important points to be aware of for the Classic version:
  - A few icons have been changed across the addon to replace missing icons in Classic.
  - Companion profiles have been disabled for mounts and non-combat pets, as Blizzard did not provide us with beta access. We will work on implementing them back as soon as possible.
  - Total RP 3: Extended will not be ported to Classic at launch. We will be evaluating if a Classic port makes sense for us to do at a later date.

## Changed

- When using the character map scan, characters with which you have set a relationship will now appear on top of the others.

	WHATS_NEW_23_5 = [[
# Changelog version 1.6.5

## Added

- Added Total RP 3: Extended version number alongside Total RP 3 version number at the bottom of the tooltip.

## Fixed

- Fixed an error when someone executes a scan in your zone. (Classic only)
- Fixed a potential error when saving a glance slot.

	WHATS_NEW_23_6 = [[
# Changelog version 1.6.6

## Added

- Added slash commands to change your roleplay status, which you can use in macros. You can now use `/trp3 status ic` to get in character, `/trp3 status ooc` to get out of character, or `/trp3 status toggle` to switch status.
- Added a chat setting to display the OOC indicator next to the name in chat.
- Added a setting to hide the map scan button if no scan is available.
- Added a roleplay language field to the main dashboard.
  - This setting is profile-based, defaults to your addon language, and allows you to indicate the language you're roleplaying in.
  - If your addon language doesn't match a player's roleplaying language, you'll see a flag at the bottom of their tooltip indicating their roleplaying language.
  - This change is mainly aimed at Classic roleplayers, as only English RP realms were made.
- Added back buttons to toggle helmet and cloak display for Classic.

## Changed

- Renamed the war mode setting to PvP mode for Classic.

## Fixed

- Fixed issues when the target bar module was disabled.
- Fixed an issue causing duplicate Mary-Sue Protocol profiles to appear in the register when unchecking "This realm only".
- Fixed a few remaining missing icons for Classic (default template 3 icons and `/trp3 roll` icons)
- Fixed an issue when using the "Right-click to open profile" setting on Classic.

# Changelog version 1.6.0

## Personal notes

You can now write personal notes inside the addon !

These notes can either be written on your own profile (if you wish to take generic notes for your character), or on someone else's profile (the top field being tied to your current profile, the bottom field being common to all your profiles). These notes are obviously private, nobody else but you can see them.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-1.tga:480:480}

To access personal notes, simply click on the new Notes button on the target frame, or open a profile and click on the Notes tab.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-2.tga:240:120}

The register also received a checkbox to only display profiles on which you wrote notes.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-3.tga:480:120}

## Added

- Added HTML support for About templates 2 and 3. You can now use the full array of HTML tags while using those templates to format their fields, using the toolbar which is now visible for all templates.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-4.tga:480:480}

- Added compatibility with other RP addons for personality traits and HTML tags.

## Changed

- The "Report profile" buttons will now both link to the [support website's page on harassment via addons](https://battle.net/support/help/product/wow/197/1501/solution), as the in-game report feature previously added was an invalid method to report addon abuse. The popup will still show a timestamp for the profile's reception, which you can provide to Blizzard CS to help them track the offense.

## Fixed

- Fixed an error which could prevent the addon from loading.
- Fixed a compatibility issue for template 3 if the addon locale was not English.

## Removed

- Removed auto-highlighting of the full text when entering focus of a text area (About fields, Currently, OOC Info...)
- Removed April Fools' code (including the forgotten rainbow companion names).

]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_1"] = [=[
# Changelog version 1.6.1

## Music system rework

- Technical changes in patch 8.2 required us to change how music is handled by the addon. **This means the update is required for musics to work.** This change should be seamless and backwards compatible (music themes from profiles coming from outdated versions should still play fine).
- This allowed for the addition of musics previously unavailable (looking at you, void elf musics).
- The duration of all musics should now be visible in the music browser line tooltips.

## Changed

- Settings to increase color contrast in tooltips and chat have been consolidated in a single setting for both which can be found in the General settings. It also applies in more places, like the map scan tooltips.

## Fixed

- The anchor for the map scan button can now properly be set.
- Fixed a switch in Headers/Paragraph dropdown titles
- Fixed an error message that could be caused by other addons misusing official API functions.

]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_2"] = [=[
# Changelog version 1.6.2

## Added

- Added 328 icons and 20 images from patch 8.2.
- Added an indicator to the music browser when the default name of a music differs from the one matching the current filter.

## Fixed

- Fixed issues in the music data transfer between TRP and MRP.
- Fixed an issue with duplicated lines on the map scan button tooltip.
- Further speculative fixes to the map issue on login.

]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_3"] = [=[
# Changelog version 1.6.3

## Changed

- Companion tooltips will now adjust contrast for the custom color if the setting is enabled.

## Fixed

- Fixed a companion tooltip error when the API fails to return the pet type.
- Fixed an issue which could make the toolbar appear above the world map.
- Fixed an anchoring error with the target frame.

]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_4"] = [=[
# Changelog version 1.6.4

We are aware of a current issue on Retail causing **quest item usage from the objective tracker** to sometimes fail. While we do not have a fix for it just yet, **typing /reload after getting the error message** temporarily fixes the issue. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## WoW: Classic support

- Total RP 3: Classic is now available as a separate download on CurseForge and WoWInterface! Be sure to install it instead of the retail version of Total RP 3 if you plan on roleplaying in WoW: Classic.
- Important points to be aware of for the Classic version:
  - A few icons have been changed across the addon to replace missing icons in Classic.
  - Companion profiles have been disabled for mounts and non-combat pets, as Blizzard did not provide us with beta access. We will work on implementing them back as soon as possible.
  - Total RP 3: Extended will not be ported to Classic at launch. We will be evaluating if a Classic port makes sense for us to do at a later date.

## Changed

- When using the character map scan, characters with which you have set a relationship will now appear on top of the others.

]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_5"] = [=[
# Changelog version 1.6.5

## Added

- Added Total RP 3: Extended version number alongside Total RP 3 version number at the bottom of the tooltip.

## Fixed

- Fixed an error when someone executes a scan in your zone. (Classic only)
- Fixed a potential error when saving a glance slot.

]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_6"] = [=[
# Changelog version 1.6.6

## Added

- Added slash commands to change your roleplay status, which you can use in macros. You can now use `/trp3 status ic` to get in character, `/trp3 status ooc` to get out of character, or `/trp3 status toggle` to switch status.
- Added a chat setting to display the OOC indicator next to the name in chat.
- Added a setting to hide the map scan button if no scan is available.
- Added a roleplay language field to the main dashboard.
  - This setting is profile-based, defaults to your addon language, and allows you to indicate the language you're roleplaying in.
  - If your addon language doesn't match a player's roleplaying language, you'll see a flag at the bottom of their tooltip indicating their roleplaying language.
  - This change is mainly aimed at Classic roleplayers, as only English RP realms were made.
- Added back buttons to toggle helmet and cloak display for Classic.

## Changed

- Renamed the war mode setting to PvP mode for Classic.

## Fixed

- Fixed issues when the target bar module was disabled.
- Fixed an issue causing duplicate Mary-Sue Protocol profiles to appear in the register when unchecking "This realm only".
- Fixed a few remaining missing icons for Classic (default template 3 icons and `/trp3 roll` icons)
- Fixed an issue when using the "Right-click to open profile" setting on Classic.

]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_7"] = [=[
# Changelog version 1.6.7

## Added

- Added a setting to detect speech in emotes and automatically color it.
- Added 7 icons and 1 music from patch 8.2.5.

## Changed

- The companion profiles list accessed through the target frame is now alphabetically sorted, and "Create new profile" has been moved out of it.

## Notes personnelles

Vous pouvez désormais prendre des notes personnelles depuis l'addon !

Ces notes peuvent être écrites sur votre propre profil (si vous désirez prendre des notes génériques pour votre personnage), ou sur le profil de quelqu'un d'autre (le champ supérieur étant lié à votre profil actuel, le champ inférieur étant commun à tous vos profils). Ces notes sont privées, personne d'autre que vous ne peut les voir.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-1.tga:480:480}

Pour accéder aux notes personnelles, cliquez simplement sur le nouveau bouton Notes sur la fenêtre de cible, ou ouvrez un profil et cliquez sur l'onglet Notes.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-2.tga:240:120}

Le registre a aussi reçu une option pour n'afficher que les profils pour lesquels vous avez écrit des notes.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-3.tga:480:120}

## Ajouté

- Ajout du format HTML pour les modèles 2 et 3 de l'onglet À propos. Vous pouvez désormais utiliser l'ensemble des balises lorsque vous utilisez ces modèles pour formatter leurs champs, en utilisant la barre d'outils désormais visible pour tous les modèles.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-4.tga:480:480}

- Ajout de la compatibilité avec d'autres addons RP pour les traits de personnalité et les balises HTML.

## Modifié

- Les boutons "Signaler un profil" renvoient désormais tous vers le [site d'assistance de Blizzard](https://battle.net/support/help/product/wow/197/1501/solution), la fonctionnalité de signalement en jeu précédemment ajoutée n'étant pas une méthode valide pour signaler l'abus par addon. La fenêtre affiche toujours une date et heure de réception du profil que vous pouvez fournir au service client de Blizzard afin de les aider à identifier l'offense.

## Corrigé

- Correction d'une erreur pouvant empêcher l'addon de charger.
- Correction d'une erreur de compatibilité pour le modèle 3 si la langue de l'addon n'était pas anglaise.

## Supprimé

- Suppression de la sélection automatique du texte complet après un clic dans une zone de texte (champs À propos, Actuellement, Informations HRP...)
- Suppression du code pour le poisson d'avril (RP.IO ainsi que les noms arc-en-ciel de compagnons accidentellement oubliés l'an dernier).]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_1"] = [=[# Liste des changements de la version 1.6.1

## Refonte du système de musiques

- Des changements techniques du patch 8.2 ont requis de modifier la manière de gérer la musique dans l'addon. **Ceci signifie que la mise à jour est nécessaire pour pouvoir jouer des musiques dans l'addon.** Ce changement devrait être invisible et rétrocompatible (les thèmes musicaux de profils provenant de versions antérieures devraient pouvoir être jouer sans problème).
- Ceci a permis l'ajout de musiques précédemment indisponibles (*fait signe aux musiques des elfes du vide*).
- La durée de toutes les musiques est désormais visible dans l'infobulle au survol d'une musique dans la liste.

## Modifié

- Les réglages pour augmenter le contraste des couleurs dans les infobulles et la fenêtre de discussion ont été consolidés en un seul réglage dans les paramètres généraux. Ce réglage s'applique dans des endroits supplémentaires, comme les infobulles du scan sur la carte.

## Corrigé

- L'ancrage pour le bouton de scan de la carte peut désormais être réglé correctement.
- Correction d'un échange de titres de menu déroulants pour les titres/paragraphes.
- Correction d'un message d'erreur pouvant être causé par d'autres addons utilisant mal certains fonctions de l'API de WoW.]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_2"] = [=[# Liste des changements de la version 1.6.2

## Ajouté

- Ajout de 328 icônes et 20 images du patch 8.2.
- Ajout d'un indicateur au navigateur de musiques lorsque le nom par défaut d'une musique diffère du nom correspondant au filtre actuel.

## Corrigé

- Correction de problèmes dans l'échange de données de musique entre TRP3 et MRP.=
- Correction d'une duplication de lines dans l'infobulle du bouton de scan de la carte.
- Corrections additionnelles potentielles au problème lié à la carte du monde à la connexion.]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_4"] = [=[# Liste des changements de la version 1.6.4

Nous sommes au courant d'un bug depuis le patch 8.2 bloquant parfois **l'utilisation des objets de quête depuis la liste d'objectifs**. Nous n'avons pas encore de correctif, mais **vous pouvez taper /reload lorsque le message d'erreur apparaît** pour corriger temporairement le problème. Nos excuses pour le désagrément.

## Support pour WoW: Classic

- Total RP 3: Classic est désormais disponible en téléchargement séparé sur CurseForge et WoWInterface ! Assurez-vous d'installer cette version à la place de la version standard de Total RP 3 si vous prévoyez de faire du jeu de rôle sur WoW: Classic.
- Les points importants à noter pour la version Classic :
  - Quelques icônes ont été changées dans l'addon pour remplacer des icônes manquantes dans Classic.
  - Les profils pour montures et familiers pacifiques ont été désactivés, Blizzard ne nous ayant pas fourni d'accès à la beta. Nous les réimplémenterons dès que possible.
  - Total RP 3: Extended ne sera pas porté pour Classic à sa sortie. Nous évaluerons à l'avenir l'intérêt d'un portage.

## Modifié

- Lors d'un scan de personnages sur la carte, les personnages avec lesquels vous avez une relation apparaîtront désormais au-dessus des autres.]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_6"] = [=[
# Liste des changements de la version 1.6.6

## Ajouté

- Ajout de commandes pour changer votre statut roleplay, utilisables dans des macros. Vous pouvez désormais utiliser `/trp3 status ic` pour passer RP, `/trp3 status ooc` pour passer HRP, ou `/trp3 status toggle` pour inverser votre statut.
- Ajout d'un paramètre de discussion pour afficher un indicateur HRP à côté du nom dans la fenêtre de discussion.
- Ajout d'un paramètre pour cacher de bouton de scan de la carte si aucun scan n'est disponible.
- Ajout d'un champ de langage de jeu de rôle sur la fenêtre principale.
  - Ce paramètre est défini par profil, choisit le langage de l'addon par défaut, et vous permet d'indiquer la langage dans lequel vous effectuez du jeu de rôle.
  - Si le langage de votre addon ne correspond pas au langage de jeu de rôle d'un autre joueur, un drapeau en bas de l'infobulle indique leur langage de jeu de rôle.
  - Ce changement est principalement destiné aux rôlistes sur Classic, du fait de l'absence de serveurs RP non-anglais.
- Ajout de boutons pour changer l'affichage des casques et capes pour Classic.

## Modifié

- Le paramètre de mode de guerre a été renommé pour Classic pour référencer le mode PvP.

## Corrigé

- Correction de problèmes lorsque le module de fenêtre de cible était désactivé.
- Correction d'un bug causant l'apparition de profils Mary-Sue Protocol en double dans le registre en désélectionnant "Ce royaume uniquement".
- Correction de quelques icônes manquantes sur Classic (icônes par défaut du modèle 3, icônes pour `/trp3 roll`)
- Correction d'un bug avec l'utilisation du paramètre "Clic droit pour ouvrir un profil" sur Classic.

]=],
	["WHATS_NEW_23_7"] = [=[# Liste des changements de la version 1.6.7

## Ajouté

- Ajout d'un paramètre de détection de dialogue dans les emotes pour les colorer automatiquement.
- Ajout de 7 icones et 1 musique du patch 8.2.5.

## Modifié

- La liste de profils de compagnons accessible via la fenêtre de cible est désormais triée par ordre alphabétique, et "Créer nouveau profil" a été déplacé hors de cette liste.]=]

## Notas personales

¡Ahora puedes escribir notas personales en el addon!

Estas notas podrán ser escritas tanto en tu propio perfil (si quieres tomar notas genéricas para tu personaje) o en el de otra persona (el campo superior ligado a tu perfil actual, el campo inferior es el común a todos tus perfiles). Estas notas son obviamente privadas, por lo que solo tú podrás verlas.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-1.tga:480:480}

Para acceder a las notas personales, haz clic en el nuevo botón Notas del marco del objetivo, o abre un perfil y haz clic en la pestaña de Notas.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-2.tga:240:120}

El registro también tiene una casilla de verificación para solo mostrar aquellos perfiles en los que hayas escrito notas.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-3.tga:480:120}

## Añadido

- Se ha añadido soporte HTML para los modelos 2 y 3 de Acerca de. Puedes formar etiquetas HTML mientras usas dichos modelos para dar formato a los campos, usando la barra de herramientas que ahora es visible para todos los modelos.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-4.tga:480:480}

- Se ha agregado compatibilidad con otros addons de rol para los rasgos de personalidad y etiquetas HTML.

## Cambios

- Los botones de "Reportar perfil" ahora llevarán a [la página de soporte de acoso a través de addons] (https://battle.net/support/help/product/wow/197/1501/solution), puesto que la herramienta de reporte del juego anteriormente añadido era un método inválido para reportar el abuso del addon. El popup mostrará la hora en la recepción del perfil, lo cual puedes proporcionar al soporte de Blizzard para ayudarles a rastrear la ofensa.

## Arreglado

- Se ha arreglado un error que provocaba que el addon no cargara.
- Se ha solventado un problema de compatibilidad con el modelo 3 si el idioma del addon no era el inglés.

## Eliminado

- Se ha eliminado el resaltado automático del texto al ingresar el foco de un área de texto (campos Acerca de, Actualmente, Fuera de personaje, Información...)
- Se ha eliminado el código de April Fool's (incluido el olvidado arcoíris en los nombres de compañero).]=]
